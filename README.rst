pyzmq-ctypes: Python bindings for 0MQ (ctypes version)
======================================================

This project is an attempt to build a partially-compatible version of
PyZMQ running on pypy. Since I don't have time to write a Cython that
compiles to Python instead of C, I decided to write some ctypes bindings
for ZeroMQ.

These bindings introspect parts of the ZeroMQ library by using the C
compiler and a C parser, so you will still need those in order to
use this.

=======

The ctypes bindings were written by Daniel Holth <dholth@gmail.com>
based on a copy of the original PyZMQ with the Cython bits taken out.

The orginal PyZMQ was started by and continues to be led by Brian
E. Granger (ellisonbg AT gmail DOT com).
